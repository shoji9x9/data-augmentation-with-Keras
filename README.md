# Overview
This shows how to augment image data using Keras on TensorFlow 2.0 Alpha.

# Description
ImageDataGenerator augments CIFAR-10 dataset and we can see the result. In this case, there are rotation, horizontal flip, and zoom as a kind of augmentation.

# Dataset
This dataset can be found [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

# How to open it on Google Colaboratory
